void main () {
  String greeting = 'Welcome,';
  String user = 'Alice';
  print ("$greeting $user!");
}

void main () {
  dynamic greeting = 'Welcome,';
  dynamic user = 'Alice';
  user = 25;
  print ("$greeting $user!");
}


- In this lesson, I understand that if I change the variable into the dynamic 
it won't cause any compiling error because the dynamic variable is a variable
that is flexible and it will disabled static typing variable.
