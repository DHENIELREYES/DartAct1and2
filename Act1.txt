void main () {
  String name = 'Alice';
  print ("Welcome, $name!");
 
  dynamic name1 = 'Alice';
  name1 = 25;
  print ("Welcome, $name1!");
 }

- In this lesson, I understand that if I change the variable into the dynamic 
it won't cause any compiling error because the dynamic variable is a variable
that is flexible and it will disabled static typing variable.
